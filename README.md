# python-challenge

This repo contains a pair of analyses results that were obtained by using Python and the data sets supplied by the instructors. The original data sets can be found within the "Resources" folder located inside the "PyBank" and "PyPoll" folders within this repository, respectively.

The first analysis looked at data from the financial records of a hypothetical company. The objective was to determine the total number of months in the dataset as well as calculate various metrics relating to the Profit/Loss during the time frame covered by the data set and export the findings to a text file. You can find the results of this analysis by navigating to the text file entitled "Financial_Analysis.txt" located in the "python-challenge/PyBank/Analysis" folder within this repository.

The second analysis examined the results of a hypothetical election recently held in a small, rural town. The objective was to determine the number of votes that were cast in the election as well as calculate various metrics relating to the votes each candidate received and who won the election itself. Similar to the PyBank exercise, we were then tasked with exporting the results of our analysis to a text file. You can find these results by navigating to the text file entitled "Electoral_Analysis.txt" located in the "python-challenge/PyPoll/Analysis" folder within this repository.
